### First use Ironlauncher to start the project and create the backend - we will use the json flag to create a json api template.

### In this example our project will be called 'projector'

### Select "No auth"

```bash
$ npx ironlauncher@latest projector-server --json
```

### To create the client we will use create-react-app
```bash
$ npx create-react-app projector-client
```

### This should result in the same structure that we have [in this example](https://github.com/Ironhack-Berlin-WDFT-March-2023/w8d1)

### Then we can connect both repos to github and make the first commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin master/main
```

Now we have our basic project structure ðŸ’ª 

The other team members can now clone the repos from GitHub (make sure to run npm install in both the server and in the client folder).

Happy hacking ðŸ’™
